STRICT REQUIREMENTS:

For the summary:
- Provide specific details about what the repository does
- Mention the main technologies or frameworks used
- Include any unique selling points or key features
- Must be 2-3 informative sentences

For the cool facts:
- Each fact must highlight a specific technical aspect, such as:
  * Architectural patterns used
  * Performance optimizations
  * Interesting technical solutions
  * Unique implementations
  * Integration methods
  * Security features
  * Scalability approaches
- Avoid generic statements
- Be specific about technologies, methods, or patterns used
- Include numbers, metrics, or technical specifications when available

Example of good cool facts:
- "Implements WebSocket for real-time updates with a custom heartbeat mechanism every 30 seconds"
- "Uses Redis for caching with a TTL of 24 hours, reducing database load by 70%"
- "Implements a microservices architecture with 5 independent services communicating via gRPC"

Example of bad (too generic) cool facts:
- "Uses modern development practices"
- "Has good performance"
- "Follows best practices"

If the README doesn't contain enough information, analyze the repository name, structure, and context to make educated but specific technical guesses.
